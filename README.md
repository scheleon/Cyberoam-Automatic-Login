# Cyberoam-Automatic-Login
Automation of boring login task 

## Each time you connect your lan you are asked to enter your login credentials.
## Why do it when you can skip the boring stuff, login just by typing a single command. All you need to do is run the setup.sh.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scheleon/Cyberoam-Automatic-Login.git
cd Cyberoam-Automatic-Login
cd unix
./setup.sh
```

Enter your username and password, done.

### Next time you need to login, just start a terminal window and login using the following command. 

```
login
```

You need to change server address in login.sh and logout.sh, if you are not from BIT Mesra.
